#Portfolio

*update 2/6/2024* I have revamped my portfolio! ðŸ˜Š


> So I have finally reached the end of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course and the last project was of course the portfolio website.
 
I will say this is always my weak point, designing a portfolio website not because of creating it but because of thinking out how I want it to look
knowing full well the idea I have in my head is beyond my skill so it comes down to figuring out how to pull off something at my skill level, and 
I will admit I am ok with how this turned out.

If there is one thing I will love to get out of getting into Web Design is being able to one day comeback to all these old projects and just be able to 
complete revamp them like something crazy like I am talking a massive leap in skill i would have gotten so could at coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript & whatever
other programs I hope to pick up along the way.

But until then he is the final prjocet to acquire my certification and I hope i continue to improve, grow, & truly land a career doing this, becasue I really do 
want to learn more and get better at this.
